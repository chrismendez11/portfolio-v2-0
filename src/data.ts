Also there's 3 filters buttons, one for most recent items, and two in order to filter by lowest to highest price and vice versa. Additionally I added 2 buttons to make the App more interactive with the user. One button in order to get more coins and there's another one which show you the reddem history (right now the reddem history is showed in the console).",
